\title{Measure the errors in the distributions of degrees pdi}
\usage{
errors.pdi(sp)
}
\arguments{
\item{sp}{a synthetic population, as produced by \code{\link{matching.generate}} or \code{\link{matching.solve}}.}
}
\value{
a dataframe containing the difference between the expected and actual distribution of degrees
}
\description{
Returns the difference between the actual and input distributions of degrees. 
For instance a "minus one" means we reached one less than expected.
}
\seealso{
\code{\link{errors.pdj}} for the measure of distributions of degrees pdj
