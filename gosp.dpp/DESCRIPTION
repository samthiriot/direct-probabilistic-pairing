Description: Peering of entities for Synthetic populations, 
	such as composing entities within each others (individuals in households,
	households in dwellings...) or creating links 
	(social links between individuals). 
	It relies on the Direct Probabilistic Peering method: the user 
	provides two samples to be linked together, probabilities for entities 
	to have different degrees (count of entities each entity should be linked
	with), and probabilities for two individuals to be linked according to 
	their characteristics. The problem is then solved anatically depending 
	to user constrainsts, before a direct generation of the links 
	between the populations.
